Portfolio optimization and index tracking for the FTSE index using genetic algorithm

This application using GA to replicatethe market index such as FTSE-100. While, FTSE-100 is an index containing 100 portfolios. The 
replication is limited to only 15. We contruct estimated portfolio returns for a subset of stocks picked from the FTSE-100 stocks 
listsings. 

Performance evalaution measures allow rebalancing of the synthetic index generated by the GA, after a certain time period. Or, in 
case of an increased difference between the actual and the syntheic index, we trigger a hard reset.
